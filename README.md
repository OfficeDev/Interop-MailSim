Office Interop Tools - MailSim

MailSim (*Mail Simulator*) is a Microsoft Windows command-line tool that automates email operations in Microsoft Outlook 2013. 
MailSim reads user-defined XML configuration files and creates Outlook traffic, such as test email or folder operations. 
This test traffic is designed to exercise an Outlook-compatible email server in a multi-client environment for extended periods. 
During execution, MailSim displays client-side process messages, and also stores those messages in log files, for monitoring and troubleshooting.
