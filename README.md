# Interop-MailSim
Office Interoperability Tools - MailSim

MailSim (*Mail Simulator*) is a Microsoft Windows command-line tool that automates email operations through Microsoft Outlook 2013, or for Outlook for Office 365. MailSim reads user-defined XML configuration files and creates Outlook traffic, such as test email or folder operations. This test traffic is designed to exercise an Outlook-compatible email server, or an intermediary, in a multi-client environment for extended periods. 

MailSim uses the Outlook Object Model for controlling an Outlook 2013 instance, or else uses Representational State Transfer (REST) calls to an Office 365 email account.

During execution, MailSim displays client-side process messages, and also stores those messages in log files, for monitoring and troubleshooting.
