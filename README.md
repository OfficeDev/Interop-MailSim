# Interop-MailSim
Office Interoperability Tools - MailSim

MailSim (*Mail Simulator*) is a Microsoft Windows command-line tool that automates email operations through Microsoft Outlook 2013, or for Outlook for Office 365. MailSim reads user-defined XML configuration files and creates Outlook traffic, such as test email or folder operations. This test traffic is designed to exercise an Outlook-compatible email server, or an intermediary, in a multi-client environment for extended periods. 

During execution, MailSim displays client-side process messages, and also stores those messages in log files, for monitoring and troubleshooting.
